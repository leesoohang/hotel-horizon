# Group Project 1 â€“ Hotel Horizon
## Description
This application is designed for corporate travelers who are looking to book hotel accommodation, in a city where they go on a business trip. Using search criteria, they are presented with hotel options according to popularity. 

When browsing hotels, users can check more photos, location on map and nearby restaurants in detail. The price per night, in total and rating information gives a better idea for business travelers if they are on a budget.

Users are able to save hotel to favorites in order to check again later. Whenever they are ready, they can go back to the application, locate the favorite list and proceed with booking.
