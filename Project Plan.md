# Group Project 1 
## User Story

As a traveler I want to find hotels for my trip, and interesting places nearby, so that I can plan for the accommodation and activities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.	When the user goes to the application, they are able to find the place of interest via search.
2.	Search filters are available when hotel options are presented, including check-in/check-out date, ratings, number of people, 
3.	The user is able to find information of places (attractions, restaurants, etc.) nearby.
4.	Bookmark/Favorite options should be next to the search results, so users are allowed to store certain items to local storage for future sessions.
